# odin-recipes

This is a basic HTML project to practice HTML fundamentals.
Going back to the fundamentals helps me rebuild my confidence and competence.
Also, sometimes I learn new things!

The repo is a basic page with links to recipes. For now the website won't be
pretty but it can be styled later.
